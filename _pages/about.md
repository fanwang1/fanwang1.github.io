I am currently a Research Assistant Professor in the [Department of Geography](https://geog.hkbu.edu.hk/) at [Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU)](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/en.html) and a member of the [Chemistry-Climate Modeling Group](https://climatechem.github.io/) led by [Prof. Meng Gao](https://geog.hkbu.edu.hk/people/academic-and-teaching-staff/prof-gao-meng.html). My research focuses on atmospheric chemistry, climate modeling, climateâ€“air pollution interactions, and the impacts of climate change on large-scale climate patterns, regional weather, and air quality.

I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology (NUIST) in 2018 and 2021, respectively, and my Ph.D. from Hong Kong Baptist University in 2025.

I have authored or co-authored more than 20 papers in leading peer-reviewed journals, including 12 as first or co-first author, with two in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and one in Nature Communications.
